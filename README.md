EventHub benefits a particular organization with multiple sub-groups to manage all their events through a common portal irrespective of the type of event. Whether it is a sporting event or a teaching-learning event or just a normal ceremony. All of them could be advertised using EventHub. It also enables a user with permission to view the list of participants and their information if necessary. 


## Features

- <b>Login & Sign up:</b> Users can sign up if they are new to our site & log in if they are already part of our virtual family. They can also give an avatar in their profile.

- <b>Create an event:</b> We have also given the privilege to the organizers to create events & make them accessible to the whole world.

- <b>Register Event:</b> Users can find various kinds of events & register for events. Organizers of a particular event also get to approve or cancel the request based upon their evaluation.

- <b>Search Events:</b> To give a better experience to our users, we have added a search event feature so that they can find events according to their interests & city.

- <b>Chat with Organizer:</b> We believe that for the successful organization of an event, there must be communication between the organizer & participants. For that, we have given them the functionality to virtually message each other via our integrated messaging feature.

- <b>Give Review:</b> No events are perfect & there is always room for improvements. To help the organizers get feedback for improvement  & participants express their thoughts on events, we have added the review feature.
